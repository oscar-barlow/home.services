# Secrets Management

This project uses Docker Swarm secrets to manage sensitive configuration data.

## Notes

- Secrets are managed using Docker Swarm's built-in secret management
- Code-server authentication is disabled via configuration file
- Prometheus does not require password authentication in this setup
