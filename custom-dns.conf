# Pi-hole custom DNS configuration for local services

# Tell dnsmasq to handle all *.home domains locally instead of forwarding to upstream DNS
# This is critical for using non-standard TLDs like .home in your local network
local=/home/

# Don't forward reverse DNS lookups for private IP ranges
# This improves performance for local address lookups
bogus-priv

# Set explicit domain for local network (optional but recommended)
# domain=home

# Custom DNS entries mapping domain names to your Raspberry Pi's IP
# Format: address=/domain/IP-address

# Jellyfin media server
address=/jellyfin.home/192.168.1.204

# Instructions website
address=/instructions.home/192.168.1.204

# Pi-hole admin interface
address=/pi.hole/192.168.1.204

# Add more custom domains as needed following the same pattern
# address=/example.home/192.168.1.204

# If you want to resolve regular domains to local services, you can do that too
# address=/my-media-server.com/192.168.1.204
